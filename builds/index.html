      <h2>Media</h2>
      <p>A quick way to create a two-column pattern that shows an image next to a photo. In Bootstrap 4, you gain the ability
        to center elements using flexbox classes. A couple of things to watch out for is that these will always render as
        single columns and can sometimes be too wide, so these particular media elements are inside an eight-column grid.</p>

      <h4>Yodelay Hee Hoo!</h4>
      <p>Yodel grew up in a family of singers and loud talkers and could never get a word in edgewise. Then his vast talent
        for yodeling emerged. Now he performs to adoring fans throughout the world, and always has the loudest voice at the
        dinner table.</p>

      <h2>Hatching a plan</h2>
      <p>You might not realize this, but monsters, by their very nature, are master planners. They plan their finances, their
        diets, their exercise routines, their leisure time, and even their grocery lists. They also organize some pretty
        memorable parties! Some scientists theorize that monsters had to be strong planners to compete with dragons, fairies,
        and gnomes in the business and technology markets. Whatever the origin of their efficiency, if you ever need a wedding
        planner, call a monster!</p>

      <h2>Emerging talent</h2>
      <p>Monsters are forces to reckon with in the burgeoning technology industry. They're masterminds in HTML, CSS, PHP, and
        all those other cool acronyms, and they have a special fondness for building games and productivity apps for Android
        and iOS devices. And not surprisingly, they love the freedom and creativity that Bootstrap provides. In fact, they're
        often found hanging out in great responsive layouts, just like this one here.</p>
