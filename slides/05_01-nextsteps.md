> > Author Notes:

Hey there, this is Ray Villalobos and thanks for watching this course. Bootstrap is a great framework and hopefully working through a layout, gave you some practical experience of what it's really like. Here's a couple of other things you should take a look at.

First, I created this project as a template, so that you could use it for other projects, I find myself often going back to previous projects and borrowing code from them. I created a special that is the official place for this template. It looks a bit different to what you see on this course, but having taking the course, it should be easy enough to adapt.

Also, this was a project based approach that was more of a walkthrough. I built a separate course to go deeper into each of the different bootstrap components and also to help you understand important concepts like the grid, so make sure you take a look at that.

Our library is also full of great bootstrap content and I'll be doing some other course. If you want to know what I'm up to, check out my personal site raybo.org, where I have a list of all of my courses as well as articles. There are links to my social media accounts where you can connect with me, so hopefully I'll get to hear from you.

Again, thanks for watching and stay curious.
